# Dobby QA

This is the coordination log between Codex implementation cycles and Dobby review.

## Review Protocol

Dobby reviews after Codex pushes to `codex/openclaw-playground`.

Dobby should check, as relevant:

- `git status --short --branch`
- latest commit/diff
- `npm test`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run context:check`
- local app browser QA for changed flows
- console errors and obvious responsive issues

## Current QA Focus

MVP reliability:

- Neon-backed persistence and user scoping.
- No data-loss risk in core flows.
- Live/stale/unavailable price semantics.
- Correct math and matching tooltips/charts.
- CSV/backup export confidence.
- Good-enough dashboard/transaction/portfolio UX.

## Leo Review Notes

- Leo's immediate need is a reliable product he can use personally now.
- UI can be imperfect if the product is safe and the numbers are trustworthy.
- Do not prioritize AI, news polish, scheduled emails, taxes, or fees before reliability.
